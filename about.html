    <p>Since our modest beginnings in 2005 with a little space in Torontoâ€™s stylish Yorkville locale, Pizza's Mug development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Indian-roused takeout food.
        Our menu highlights things that utilization the sound and fragrant flavors, however, forgets the stuffing ghee, spread, oil, and overwhelming cream
        it has developed to incorporate four superb takeout areas in Toronto with additional to come sooner rather than later. Our group takes pride in the way that we can furnish our new and faithful clients with extraordinary tasting Indian-roused nourishment that is not normal for that at some other Indian eatery you visit.
